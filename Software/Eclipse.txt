To fix freeze-up on startup:
	1) Delete [Workspace Directory]/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.snap

If haven't helped:
	2) run eclispe with -clean and -refresh arguments:
./eclipse -clean -refresh

If 1-2) have not helped:
	3) take a backup of .metadata folder(just in case you need to revert back) and delete the following directory:
YOUR_WORKSPACE_HOME/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.project
or
YOUR_WORKSPACE_HOME/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.projects
restart Eclipse problem should be solved

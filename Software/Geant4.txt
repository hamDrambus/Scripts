geant4 v10.00.p04

create build folder (e.g. .../labware/geant4_10.00.p04/build)
//the main geant folder is .../labware/geant4_10.00.p04

!!! Qt must be installed
!!! Visual Studio 2015 is required. Attempts to use VS2013 and VS2013 CPT_Nov2013 have failed at Geant10.00.p04,
Geant10.04, Geant10.01.p03 and Geant10.02.p03. Source code fixes were required for 10.04 for CPT_Nov2013 IIRC
(plain VS2013 is incompatible with v10.04).

Mind that env vars of Qt must be set in installed locations, not in the source code!
In my case F:\Qt_5.7.0\src-5.7.0 is source folder and F:\Qt_5.7.0\ is an install folder
	Env_vars (not created by me, but I deleted "\src-5.7.0" in them so they point to the install locations):
	QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=F:\QT_5.7.0\plugins\platforms
	Qt5Core_DIR=F:\Qt_5.7.0\lib\cmake\Qt5Core
	QTDIR=F:\Qt_5.7.0
Also Path =
...;F:\Qt_5.7.0\src-5.7.0\gnuwin32\bin;F:\Qt_5.7.0\src-5.7.0\qtbase\bin;...;F:\Qt_5.7.0\lib;F:\Qt_5.7.0\qtbase\include;F:\Qt_5.7.0\bin;F:\Qt_5.7.0\qtbase\bin

06.02.2018 UPD: it's all wrong for some reason. The first thing is Qt must be installed not from the source but by the
installer (.exe). Mind to use 32bit (mb 64 is good, but in must be the same as Geant4 platform) and appropriate visual
studio (2015, because all of the sudden geant4 code compiled in the vs2013 fails to run (std::bad_alloc crush at examples
as Geant4 classes constructors, or NULL result of find_particle(char*))).
	0) If only set QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH, Qt5Core_DIR, QTDIR and PATH, Qt5 won't be found (cmake will write
that it failed to find Qt4 as it is fallback). Error will be in 117 line of $G4/cmake/modulles/Geant4InterfaceOptions.cmake
By looking into the code there and using MESSAGE("bla-bla") I determined that
	Qt5Gui_DIR
	Qt5Widgets_DIR
	Qt5OpenGL_DIR
	Qt5PrintSupport_DIR
	Qt5Core_DIR
must be set to the folders corresponding to the *Config.cmake files (something like $Qt_Installation\lib\cmake\Qt5<Module>)
where in case of installing precompiled version Qt_Installation=F:\Qt5.7.1\Qt5.7\msvc2015
or F:\Qt_5.7.1\qtbase for in-source manual build (Also don't use outsource build).
Whether QTDIR is required at all is unclear. PATH is mandatory for sure as VS will look there for includes, libs and qmake.
Also	QMAKESPEC=F:\Qt5.7.1\5.7\msvc2015\mkspecs\win32-msvc
and	QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=F:\Qt5.7.1\5.7\msvc2015\plugins\platforms
are necessary. Paths may differ for the different ways of installing (build from source vs precompiled) and obv. for
different install locations.

Sidenote: Compiling unrelated to Geant4 Qt program for build from source Qt is ok. No crushes that is.

1) Open VisualStudio 2015 command prompt.

2) "F:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat" for vs2013
or "F:\Program Files (x86)\Visual Studio Community 2015\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat" for vs2015

3) See official installation guide for cmake parameters. Qt-related problems are covered briefly.

4) cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="F:\Username\Desktop\Top\5th year\labware\geant4_10.00.p04\install" -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="F:\Qt_5.7.0\qtbase\lib\cmake\Qt5" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON ../
//-DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATADIR="F:\Username\Desktop\Top\5th year\labware\geant4_10.02.p02\install\share\Geant4-10.2.2\data"
//ARM DOEST NOT mean x32, for x64 write Win64 (mind that Qt also must be x64 then)
//for x32 write nothing

06.02.2018 UPD: Fails as well. I managed to with vs2013 build after tedious source code fixes,
but geant4 constructors crush. Use (-G "Visual Studio 14 2015" is default if VS2015 have been isntalled (even if deleted later))
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="F:\Username\Desktop\Top\5th year\labware\geant4_10.02.p03\install" -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON ../
23.01.2018 UPD (geant4 v10.04): 
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" -T "CTP_Nov2013" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="F:\Username\Desktop\Top\5th year\labware\geant4_10.04\install" -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON ../
//END OF 23.01.2018 UPD
//END OF 06.12.2018 UPD

5) 3 equivalent (in theory) ways:
 1) may use build/Geant4.sln - visual studio project, build it in order to finish installation
 then select INSTALL project and build it (probably can build only this one), it will actually install, not only build

 2) or "cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo" //if this one is chosen then the line below must be run as well.

 3) or "cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo --target install"
 

6) cmake examples. For this Geant4Config.cmake fix is requred - 
geant4 module requres Qt4 even so it has Qt5 and so find_package(Qt4 REQUIRED) line (228 or 244, it depends)
in Geant4Config.cmake must be commented (# is comment). File location can be seen if tried cmaking examples without the fix.

7) set exampleB1 (e.g.) as startup project (right click). Otherwise it will try launch ALL_BUILD.exe which is not created.

8) make sure data paths are set in environment variables. Otherwise at least B1 won't launch
//"...\geant4_10.00.p04\install\share\Geant4-10.0.4\data" is path by default
//google "geant4 data environment variables" for details
//or configure with -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON from the let-go.

9) Use example's visual studio project (with tweaking the paths and names in the preferences) for your code.

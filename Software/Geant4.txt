geant4 v10.00.p04

create build folder (e.g. .../labware/geant4_10.00.p04/build)
//the main geant folder is .../labware/geant4_10.00.p04

Qt must be installed
Mind that env vars of Qt must be set in installed locations, not in the source code!
In my case F:\Qt_5.7.0\src-5.7.0 is source folder and F:\Qt-5.7.0\ is an install folder
	Env_vars (not created by me, but I deleted "\src-5.7.0" in them so they point to the install locations):
	QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=F:\QT_5.7.0\plugins\platforms
	Qt5Core_DIR=F:\Qt_5.7.0lib\cmake\Qt5Core
	QTDIR=F:\Qt_5.7.0
Also Path =
...;F:\Qt_5.7.0\src-5.7.0\gnuwin32\bin;F:\Qt_5.7.0\src-5.7.0\qtbase\bin;...;F:\Qt_5.7.0\lib;F:\Qt_5.7.0\qtbase\include;F:\Qt_5.7.0\bin;F:\Qt_5.7.0\qtbase\bin

1) cmd to build folder (or better use git bash)

2) "F:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat"

3) See official installation guide and cmake parameters

4) cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="F:\Bitch\Desktop\Top\5th year\labware\geant4_10.00.p04\install" -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="F:\Qt_5.7.0\qtbase\lib\cmake\Qt5" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON ../
//-DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATADIR="F:\Bitch\Desktop\Top\5th year\labware\geant4_10.02.p02\install\share\Geant4-10.2.2\data"
//ARM DOEST NOT mean x32, for x64 write Win64 (mind that Qt also must be x64 then)
//for x32 write nothing

5) build/Geant4.sln - visual studio project, build it in order to finish installation
//No cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
//or cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo --target install

6) select INSTALL project and build it (probably can be 5th step as it will build all the rest).
It will actually install, not only build 

7) cmake examples. For this Geant4Config.cmake fix is requred - 
geant4 module requres Qt4 even so it has Qt5 and so find_package(Qt4 REQUIRED) line (228 or 244, it depends)
in Geant4Config.cmake must be commented (# is comment). File location can be seen if tried cmaking examples without the fix.

8) set exampleB1 (e.g.) as startup project (right click). Otherwise it will try launch ALL_BUILD.exe which is not created.

8.5) make sure data paths are set in environment variables. Otherwise at least B1 won't launch
//"...\geant4_10.00.p04\install\share\Geant4-10.0.4\data" is path by default
//google "geant4 data environment variables" for details

9) Use example's visual studio project (with tweaking the paths and names in the preferences) for your code.

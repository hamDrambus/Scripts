 0) It's better to use Dolphin File Manager (default in SL7):
	via Software Center (easier than using bash)

 1) Ubuntu 15.10 GUI copy bug: coping form shared directory (owned by root, I gather this is the issue for any not user ownned
directory, but haven't checked) to some directory will fail if files with such names had been already copied to the target
location, even if they were later removed! Instead of coping of new files old ones are either stay or restored. This was on
Oracle Virtual Box machine. Use terminal's >cp $from_file $to_file instead.

 2) Virtual Box can change the number of processors without worry in between guest OS launch.

 3) mouting shared folder:
Install virtual drive drivers: VBox's menu (left Ctrl+Home by default): Devices->Insert Guest Additions CD Image
then auto installation will run

	>sudo -i //enter root
	>password entering
	>mount -t vboxsf $HostFolderNameInVirtualBox $where to mount (must exist - not created)
change of owner (does not seem to work):
	>chown $USER -R $path_to_folder //$USER is a real env. var.
	>exit //from root

 5) paths:
starting with / - absolute paths
/home/perser/Documets - standart Documents folder for user named perser
not starting with / - relative paths
../  - parent dir

 6)Commands
echo - display:
	>echo $GARFIELD_HOME
prints the value of GARFIELD_HOME environment variable
	>export GARFIELD_HOME=/home/perser/Documents/GarfieldPP
	>export HEED_DATABASE=$GARFIELD_HOME/Heed/heed++/database
creates env. variables
	>source $file_name.sh
runs .sh file. Works when simple file_name.sh is denied access.
use this command to initialize root env. vars. (thisroot.sh)
https://superuser.com/questions/46139/what-does-source-do
	>cp $from_file $to_file
copy
	>ls
list directories
	>rmdir
removes dir
	>apt-get target install $package_name
loads and installs package
	>./CellTest
executes CellTest program (in the same directory)
	>command && (command1 ; command2) || (command3)
executes command. If it exists with error code (returns not 0) command3 executed otherwise command1 and 2 are consecuvely
executed. If any fails 3 executed.
example:>make && (echo -e "make ok\n"; .Cell)|| (echo -e "make error\n")
-e flag enables special characters
; allows several commands in one line

 7) In order to change vhd disk location in the host OS modification of Oracle VM file required, it is impossible to do
via GUI (disconnecting disk, relocating it and connecting again yields 'the disk with number ... is already registered' error)
Go to C:\Users\$(USER_NAME)\VirtualBox VMs\$(VM_NAME) and change disk path in the .vbox file.

 8) Installing SWAP disk (optionnaly may delete previous swap):
	1) Add disk to virtual machine
	2) Format it (was done via Disks GUI programm)
	3) (NOT optionally for the swap disk:) set mount options (mount at startup, select label and mount point(folder))
	4) In mounted point (/media/perser/swapDisk in my case) create a file with desired swap size):
>fallocate -l 21g /media/perser/swapDisk/swap
(if file size exceeds available space file will be created with all available space used)
	5) >sudo chmod 600 /media/perser/swapDisk/swap
For security
	6) >sudo mkswap /media/perser/swapDisk/swap
	7) >sudo swapon /media/perser/swapDisk/swap
Now swap is set up but after reboot 'sudo swapon /media/perser/swapDisk/swap' will have to be repeated.
	8) In order to set up swap at setup add line to /etc/fstab (i.g. via >sudo gedit /etc/fstab):
	/media/perser/swapDisk/swap none swap sw 0 0
Beware that this line must go after /media/perser/swapDisk has been mounted (that's why 3rd point was required, note that
disk mount is listed in the /etc/fstab), because file can't be used as swap if system has not connected the disk
containing it yet. In case of automount of swap disk this line has no effect.

 9) Setting environment variables and launching scripts at statup.
	1) move .sh script to /etc/profile.d
Note that LD_LYBRARY_PATH is an exception and can only be set interactively in terminal or using /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
configuration files. (Required for Elmer for example)
	2) Add files to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf with path to libraries, e.g.:
	>sudo touch /etc/ld.so.conf.d/elmer.conf
	add "/mnt/formerSwap/Elmer/install/lib" to that file
	and >sudo ldconfig
		(only once, not required at the system boot)

	3) //UPD: does not work.// Also mounting is impossible in /etc/profile.d, so mounting shared with Host folder must be
done via 
	adding <name_of_share>   /path/to/mountpoint   vboxsf   <options>  0   0
	to the /etc/fstab file:
		1) For mount of shared with host folder to be available user (perser in my case) must be int vboxsf group:
		>sudo usermod -a -G groupName userName
		>sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf perser	
		2) Next instead of
		>sudo mount -t vboxsf SharedVirt /home/perser/Shared
		use 
		SharedVirt   /home/perser/Shared   vboxsf   auto  0   0
		in the /etc/fstab
	3) >sudo mount -t vboxsf SharedVirt /home/perser/Shared
Only this seems to work

2) For ROOT the following packages required (beside preinstalled) https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites (via apt-get install <name>) (packages' names depend on OS):
git dpkg-dev cmake binutils
libx11-dev OR libX11-devel on SL7
libxpm-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libxft-dev
gfortran (this one is necessary for garfield)
Recommeded (? not sure, but python support will not harm):
python-dev (python 2.7 is pre-unstalled, but not its libraries)

Compilation procedure and parameters:

$ cd to root's build folder
	$ $CMAKE_HOME/cmake root_source_folder(with CMakeList.txt) -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PRFIX=<path to root isntallfolder. If by default (unix bin folder), then do not specify this parameter> -Dgnuinstall=ON (this one to use default options for Unix OS) -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/python2.7/config-x86_64-linux-gnu[or just config]/libpython2.7.so (these 2 are required as CMake may have some problem finding them. Beware, that in the message
after this command, if libs are not found, CMake will report that environment variables PYTHON_LIBRARIES and
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS are not pointing to the proper files. This is too some error, use singilar names) -Dbuiltin_gls=ON
(internet acess required as cmake will download GSL tar files and link them internally with ROOT, not sure whether this
option is required) -Ddgml=ON (cmake+garfieldPP writes that it can not find dgml component of ROOT so this is an attempt
to fix it. It is unclear though whether this does work, I believe that OpenGL is also requred. With make+garfield
everything works fine).
-Dbuiltin_fftw3=ON (for Built the FFTW3 library internally (downloading tarfile from the Web) (ROOT 6 only))
-Dfftw3=ON (Fast Fourier Transform support, requires libfftw3)
    So the command is (example):
	$ cmake ../root-6.08.04 -Dgnuinstall=ON -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/python2.7/config-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so -Dbuiltin_gsl=ON -Dgdml=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../root-6.08.04 -Dbuiltin_fftw3=ON
	OR
	$ cmake ../ -Dgnuinstall=ON -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/python2.7/config-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so -Dbuiltin_gsl=ON -Dgdml=ON -Dbuiltin_fftw3=ON -Dfftw3=ON -Dminuit2=ON
	OR
	$ cmake ../ -Dgnuinstall=ON -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.10 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/python3.10/config-3.10-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.10.so -Dbuiltin_gsl=ON -Dgdml=ON -Dbuiltin_fftw3=ON -Dfftw3=ON -Dminuit2=ON
	OR
	$ cmake ../ -Dgnuinstall=ON -Dbuiltin_gsl=ON -Dgdml=ON -Dbuiltin_fftw3=ON -Dfftw3=ON -Dminuit2=ON

make sure required componets (and python) are found

	$ cmake --build .
	$ cmake --build . --target install

!!!run root-6.08.04/bin/thisroot.sh to configure env. var-s  - every time new terminal is opened
	$ source bin/thisroot.sh
see UbuntuAndGarfieldPP.txt readme

To rebuild: delete build folder (with CMakeCache.txt) and run build again.

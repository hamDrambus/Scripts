1) Proper unicode display: Chrome->Settings->Advanced->Web Content->Customize fonts->Encoding->set to Unicode-8 or Western
(Windows 1252) - the latter was default for me.

5) For custom extension see github. At the moment (27.07.2017) the folder is C:\Program Files\Chrome Extensions\
(Note that upon loading chrome copies the files to its own folder in Users\...\AppData with other extensions)

6) Chrome updates are disabled (in order to avoid patching chrome.dll every time):
	1) Renamed 'Update' folder to 'Update_'
	2) changed register keys containing update programs HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Google\Update\...
(if recall correctly)
	3) Disable google update service (in control panel->andiminstration)

7) Backspace functionality was depricated in 51.0.2704.84 to 52.0.2743.116. I used to stay at 51 version, but after some time
youtube stopped working as well as other sites/elements. So updates are have to be done form time to time. And no more
backspace alas.
